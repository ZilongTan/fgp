# FGP
  * A Gaussian Process that satifies several fairness criteria
  * Provides code and data for the paper: *Learning Fair Representations for Kernel Models*, available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11813

### Examples
  * plot_adult_sp.m: plots statistical parity vs prediction error on the UCI adult dataset
  * plot_adult_eop.m: plots equality of opportunity vs prediction error on the UCI adult dataset
  * plot_adult_eo.m: plots equalized odds vs prediction error on the UCI adult dataset
  * runCC.m: plots statistical parity vs prediction error with multiple protected attributes on the Communities & Crime dataset

### Datasets
  * The datasets are obtained using https://github.com/jmikko/fair_ERM and https://github.com/jkomiyama/fairregresion
